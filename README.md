# VassalsDeckBuilder
This tool is for assisting me in creating a well-balanced deck of cards for my indie card game, Vassals.

Each card in the deck is a medieval coat of arms, with a shape, background color(s) and symbols or "charges", each with its own shape and color. In the game Vassals (noggingames.us), cards interact based on the number of these aspects they share in common.

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that will help me construct a deck of these cards with a well-balanced level of "connectivity"--that is, each card should on average share as many aspects in common with as many other cards as possible; but there should be no cards that share so many aspects (i.e. more than 4) that drawing such a card would give an unfair advantage.

I'm planning on using Ruby to accomplish this task. This is my first time using GitHub and one of my first practical, independent coding projects, so any advice or ideas are greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
